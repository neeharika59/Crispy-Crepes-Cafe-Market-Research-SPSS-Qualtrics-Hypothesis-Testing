We worked closely with the caf√© owner to assess the business's strengths, weaknesses, and key challenges. To better understand dining habits and preferences, we conducted in-depth interviews with both customers and non-customers, using in-person and Zoom sessions. We also designed and implemented a Qualtrics survey to analyze customer food behaviors and perceptions of the restaurant. By applying statistical techniques in SPSS, including t-tests, correlation, and regression analysis, we identified significant findings that provided actionable insights to help improve the business.
